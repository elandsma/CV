\textbf{Software Engineering Intern}
% Detailed achievements:%
\begin{itemize}
\item Assisted with development of software used by medical professionals to track surgical data gathered pre-, intra-, and post-operatively, as well as  tools used for other aspects of medical surgery such as staff scheduling and pharmacist medication accountability.
\item Contributed to creation of an "Attending Signatures" application: Doctors receive a unique URL via SMS that contains a temporary token with a time-to-live. An API endpoint receives that token and provides a list of current medical cases that require a digital signature from the user. Cases and their associated data are presented as "cards" which can be selected/deselected and submitted for signing. 
\item My primary focus was building front ends (mobile-first, written in React), as well as contribute to API endpoints written in C\#.
\item \textbf{React, JavaScript, C\#, Microsoft SQL Server, .NET}
